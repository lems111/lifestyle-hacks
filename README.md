## Free Vacation
I opened 3 credit cards last year. I have 788 credit score. 

My wife did the same, she has 766 credit score. 

We did this to get the signup bonus points, all are Chase credit cards.

We have about $3k in points. This is all intentional for vacation spending. We plan to continue our journey in credit card points.

This post helped me plan our journey with credit cards to earn points for a free vacation:

### Rules: 
1. only use the credit card on things that you would have bought without a credit card. 
  1. Meaning, don't spend for the sake of getting the signup bonus or because there's a credit card.
2. Link your bank account to the credit card account and setup automated payments to payoff the full balance.
